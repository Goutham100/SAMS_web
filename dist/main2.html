        <p>Nitrogen (N):</p>
        <p>Optimal Range: 50–200 ppm (parts per million)</p>
        <p>Deficient: Below 50 ppm</p>
        <p>Excess: Above 200 ppm (too much nitrogen can lead to excessive foliage growth at the expense of fruit production)</p>

        <p>Phosphorus (P):</p>
        <p>Optimal Range: 30–60 ppm</p>
        <p>Deficient: Below 30 ppm</p>
        <p>Excess: Above 60 ppm (high phosphorus levels may interfere with other nutrient uptake like zinc and iron)</p>

        <p>Potassium (K):</p>
        <p>Optimal Range: 200–400 ppm</p>
        <p>Deficient: Below 200 ppm</p>
        <p>Excess: Above 400 ppm (can inhibit calcium and magnesium uptake)</p>

        <p>Additional Considerations:</p>
        <p>Soil pH: Ensure the soil pH is between 6.0–6.8 for optimal nutrient availability. If the pH is off, the plant may not effectively absorb the nutrients even if NPK levels are ideal.</p>

        <p>Growth Stages: Nutrient needs may vary slightly during different growth stages (seedling, flowering, fruiting). For example:</p>
        <p>Higher nitrogen during the vegetative growth stage.</p>
        <p>More phosphorus during flowering and early fruiting.</p>
        <p>Increased potassium during fruit development for better fruit quality.</p>

        <p>By monitoring these thresholds, you can maintain the right balance of nutrients for healthy tomato plant growth.</p>
