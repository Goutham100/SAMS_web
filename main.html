        <h1>Problem Statement</h1>
        <p>Despite the increasing demand for food production in India, traditional agricultural practices face significant challenges such as soil degradation, inefficient nutrient management, and unpredictable environmental conditions. Farmers often lack access to real-time data regarding soil health, leading to suboptimal fertilizer usage, reduced crop yields, and increased environmental impact.</p>
        <p>This project aims to develop an IoT-based smart agriculture monitoring system that utilizes advanced soil nutrient analysis and data analytics to provide farmers with timely, actionable insights into soil health. By integrating machine learning algorithms for personalized crop recommendations based on real-time soil nutrient data, weather conditions, and historical farming patterns, this system seeks to empower farmers to make data-driven decisions, optimize resource use, and implement sustainable agricultural practices, ultimately enhancing productivity and environmental stewardship.</p>
